- `$recentBlogs` - Recent blog posts (3 items)
- `$testimonials` - Approved testimonials (6 items)
- `$galleryImages` - Gallery images (9 items)
- `$pageSections` - All page section content

### Page Sections Structure
All text content is editable via admin panel through the `page_sections` table:
- `home/hero/*` - Hero section text
- `home/about/*` - About section text
- `home/services/*` - Services section headers
- `home/programs/*` - Programs section headers
- `home/events/*` - Events section headers
- `home/blog/*` - Blog section headers
- `home/testimonials/*` - Testimonials section headers

## Features Implemented

### 1. Fallback Defaults
All dynamic content has fallback values using the `??` operator:
```blade
{{ $pageSections['section']['key'] ?? 'Default Value' }}
```

### 2. Image Fallbacks
Images use conditional rendering with fallbacks to default theme images:
```blade
{{ $item->image_url ? asset('storage/' . $item->image_url) : asset('img/default.jpg') }}
```

### 3. Animation Delays
Maintains staggered animation delays for smooth appearance:
```blade
data-wow-delay="{{ 0.1 + ($index * 0.2) }}s"
```

### 4. Empty States
All sections have `@forelse...@empty` blocks to handle no data gracefully

### 5. Text Truncation
Long text is limited appropriately:
- Service descriptions: 120 characters
- Program descriptions: 100 characters
- Event descriptions: 80 characters
- Blog content: 80 characters
- Event locations: 15 characters

### 6. Conditional Rendering
Optional fields only display if data exists:
```blade
@if($program->teacher_name)
    <!-- Teacher section -->
@endif
```

## Routes Used
- `route('about')` - About page
- `route('programs')` - Programs listing
- `route('programs.show', $id)` - Program detail
- `route('events.show', $id)` - Event detail
- `route('blog.show', $slug)` - Blog post detail

## Admin Panel Requirements
The admin panel should have CRUD interfaces for:
1. Page Sections (text editing)
2. Services (CRUD)
3. Programs (CRUD)
4. Events (CRUD)
5. Blog Posts (CRUD)
6. Testimonials (approval/rejection)
7. Gallery Images (CRUD)

## Database Requirements
All tables must have:
- `is_active` or similar status field
- `order` field for sorting
- Proper timestamps
- Image upload capabilities
- Related foreign keys

## Cache Considerations
Page sections are cached for 1 hour. When updating content in admin panel, clear cache:
```php
clear_page_sections_cache('home');
```

**Last Updated:** {{ now()->format('Y-m-d H:i:s') }}
**Status:** ✅ Complete - All sections dynamically connected to database
