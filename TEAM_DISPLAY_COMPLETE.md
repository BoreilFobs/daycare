# Team Members Display - Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully integrated dynamic team member display from the database into both the welcome (homepage) and team pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. **HomeController** ✅
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php`

**Added:**
- Import `TeamMember` model
- Query to fetch featured team members (up to 4)
- Pass `$teamMembers` to the view

```php
use App\Models\TeamMember;

// In index() method:
$teamMembers = TeamMember::where('is_active', true)
    ->where('is_featured', true)
    ->orderBy('order')
    ->take(4)
    ->get();

return view('welcome', compact(
    // ... other variables
    'teamMembers'
));
```

### 2. **Welcome View (Homepage)** ✅
**File:** `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`

**Updated Team Section:**
- Changed from static HTML to dynamic `@forelse` loop
- Display team members from database
- Show name, position, and image
- Display social media links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn)
- Uses `image_url` accessor for proper image paths
- Fallback to placeholder if no team members exist
- Dynamic animation delays based on index

**Key Features:**
```blade
@forelse($teamMembers as $index => $member)
    <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-3 wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="{{ 0.1 + ($index * 0.2) }}s">
        <div class="team-item border border-primary img-border-radius overflow-hidden">
            <img src="{{ $member->image_url }}" class="img-fluid w-100" alt="{{ $member->name }}">
            
            <!-- Social Links -->
            @if($member->facebook_url)
                <a href="{{ $member->facebook_url }}" target="_blank">
                    <i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i>
                </a>
            @endif
            
            <!-- Name & Position -->
            <h4 class="text-primary">{{ $member->name }}</h4>
            <p class="text-muted mb-2">{{ $member->position }}</p>
        </div>
    </div>
@empty
    <!-- Fallback content if no team members -->
@endforelse
```

### 3. **Team Page** ✅
**File:** `resources/views/pages/team.blade.php`

**Fixed:**
- Changed social media field names from `facebook`, `twitter`, `instagram` to `facebook_url`, `twitter_url`, `instagram_url`, `linkedin_url`
- Updated image display to use `image_url` accessor directly
- Added `target="_blank"` to social links
- Added LinkedIn support

**Already Had:**
- Dynamic team member loop
- Page sections integration
- Proper fallback for empty state

### 4. **TeamController** ✅
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/TeamController.php`

**Status:** Already properly configured
- Fetches active team members
- Orders by `order` field and `name`
- Passes to team page view

## Database Structure

**Team Members Table:** `team_members`

Current Data:
```
1. Linda Carlson - English Teacher (Featured, Has Image)
2. Sarah Johnson - Math (Featured, Has Image)
3. Emily Roberts - Art & Music Teacher (Featured, No Image - uses fallback)
```

All members:
- ✅ Active (`is_active = true`)
- ✅ Featured (`is_featured = true`)
- ✅ Ordered (`order` field: 1, 2, 3)

## Display Logic

### Homepage (Welcome View)
- Shows **up to 4** team members
- Filters: `is_active = true` AND `is_featured = true`
- Ordered by: `order` field ascending
- Purpose: Showcase featured team members

### Team Page
- Shows **all** active team members
- Filters: `is_active = true` only
- Ordered by: `order` field, then `name`
- Purpose: Full team directory

## Social Media Integration

Each team member can have:
- ✅ Facebook URL (`facebook_url`)
- ✅ Twitter URL (`twitter_url`)
- ✅ Instagram URL (`instagram_url`)
- ✅ LinkedIn URL (`linkedin_url`)

Social links:
- Only display if URL exists
- Open in new tab (`target="_blank"`)
- Styled with Font Awesome icons

## Image Handling

**TeamMember Model Accessor:**
```php
public function getImageUrlAttribute(): string
{
    if ($this->image && Storage::disk('public')->exists($this->image)) {
        return Storage::url($this->image);
    }
    return asset('img/team-default.jpg');
}
```

**Usage in Views:**
```blade
<img src="{{ $member->image_url }}" alt="{{ $member->name }}">
```

**Fallback:** Default image if no image uploaded

## Animation

Team members have staggered fade-in animations:
```blade
data-wow-delay="{{ 0.1 + ($index * 0.2) }}s"
```

- Member 1: 0.1s delay
- Member 2: 0.3s delay
- Member 3: 0.5s delay
- Member 4: 0.7s delay

## Testing Checklist
