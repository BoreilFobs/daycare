# ✅ Database Column Issue Fixed!

## Problem Resolved

**Error**: `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'views_count'`

**Solution**: Changed all references from `views_count` → `views`

---

## What Was Fixed

### 3 Locations Updated

1. **DashboardController.php** - Line ~44
   - Statistics calculation: `BlogPost::sum('views')`

2. **DashboardController.php** - Line ~59
   - Popular posts ordering: `->orderBy('views', 'desc')`

3. **dashboard.blade.php** - Line ~312
   - Display view count: `{{ $post->views ?? 0 }}`

---

## Root Cause

The `blog_posts` table has a column named `views` (not `views_count`).

### Actual Table Schema:
```
blog_posts columns:
- views              ← Correct name (direct column)
- comments_count     ← This is correct (used with withCount)
```

### Common Confusion:
- `views` = Direct database column ✅
- `comments_count` = Generated by `withCount('comments')` ✅  
- `views_count` = Doesn't exist ❌

---

## Verification

✅ **Search completed**: No remaining `views_count` references  
✅ **No SQL errors**: Code runs without database errors  
✅ **Dashboard loads**: Admin dashboard accessible  
✅ **Routes verified**: 2 dashboard routes registered  

---

## Testing

### Admin Dashboard Access
```
Visit: /admin/dashboard
Should see:
✅ Statistics cards with view counts
✅ Popular blog posts with view numbers
✅ No SQL errors
```

### What Now Works
- ✅ Total views calculation
- ✅ Popular posts sorted by views
- ✅ View counts display in table
- ✅ Dashboard loads successfully

---

## Prevention

For future reference, always use:
```php
// Blog Post Views (direct column)
$post->views
BlogPost::sum('views')
BlogPost::orderBy('views', 'desc')

// Comment Count (relationship aggregate)
$post->withCount('comments')->get()
$post->comments_count  // Available after withCount()
```
